# 🧩 Sudoku Puzzle Solver  
### A Genetic Algorithm–Based Approach

An intelligent **Sudoku Puzzle Solver** that leverages the power of **Genetic Algorithms (GA)** to find valid solutions efficiently.  
The application provides an interactive interface, real-time feedback, and multiple post-solution utilities to enhance user experience.

## 🚀 Overview

Sudoku is a classic constraint satisfaction problem. Instead of traditional backtracking methods, this project uses a **Genetic Algorithm**, inspired by natural evolution, to iteratively improve candidate solutions until a valid Sudoku grid is achieved.

This approach demonstrates how evolutionary algorithms can be applied to combinatorial optimization problems.

## 🛠️ How It Works (High-Level)

1. The initial population is generated based on the given Sudoku constraints.
2. Each candidate solution is evaluated using a **fitness function**.
3. Genetic operations such as:
   - Selection  
   - Crossover  
   - Mutation  
   are applied to produce better generations.
4. The process continues until a valid Sudoku solution is found or the solver is stopped.
